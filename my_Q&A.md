1. **Why Do We Need Knowledge Distillation?**
   
   (1) Model Compression (without huge drops in performance)
   
   (2) Training Efficiency
   
   - Student models can be trained faster than training from scratch.
   
   - Especially useful when labeled data is scarce, the teacher model can generate rich supervision.
   
   (3) Improved Generalization (how well a model performs on unseen data)
   
   - The student learns smoother, more informative distributions (soft targets) instead of just hard labels.
   
   - Knowledge Distillation acts as a regularizer, reducing overfitting.
     
     

2. **What will the student model learn from the teacher model?**
   
   (1) Soft Targets (Soft Labels)
   
   Instead of only learning from the **hard labels** (e.g., class 3 is correct), the student also learns from the teacher’s **output probabilities** (e.g., 0.2 for class 1, 0.7 for class 3, etc.).
   
   - These soft targets contain **dark knowledge** — relationships between classes.
   
   - Example:
     
     - Hard label: `dog`
     
     - Teacher output: `[dog: 0.85, wolf: 0.10, cat: 0.03]`
     
     - Student learns that **wolf** is more similar to **dog** than **cat** is — a nuance not visible in the hard label.
   
   (2) Intermediate Representations
   
   In advanced setups, the student can mimic:
   
   - Hidden layers
   
   - Attention maps
   
   - Feature representations
   
   This allows the student to match not just **outputs**, but also the **process** of the teacher.
   
   (3) Logits Instead of Argmax
   
   The student is trained to match the **logits** (pre-softmax values) or softened probabilities from the teacher. These provide richer supervision than just "the correct answer".
   
   

3. **Can the teacher model help train the student model if the dataset was never used to train the teacher model?**
   
   **Yes**, the teacher model can still help train the student **even if the dataset was never used to train the teacher.** Because **knowledge distillation doesn't require the dataset used to train the teacher model.** What matters is that:
   
   (1) The **teacher is well-trained** on a similar or related domain.
   
   (2) The **teacher's outputs** on the new dataset still contain meaningful information (even if it's never seen those exact samples) by producing **soft predictions** (probability distributions over classes). These outputs:
   
   - **Capture the teacher's generalization ability**.
   
   - Include information about **class relationships**, which aren’t visible from hard labels.
   
   - Help the student **learn better representations**, even if ground-truth labels are sparse or noisy.
   
   This process can:
   
   - Improve student accuracy.
   
   - Act as a form of **regularization** (preventing overfitting).
   
   - Be helpful even with **unlabeled data** (i.e., pseudo-labeling via the teacher).
   
   In conclusion, **A well-trained teacher can guide the student even on unseen data**, as long as the input domain is similar or related. This is one of the powers of knowledge distillation — it doesn't need the teacher to have seen your exact dataset before.
   
   

4. **For example, if I would like to train a DistilBERT model (student) via knowledge distillation from a BERT model (teacher), which tokenizer should I choose for the dataset?**

   Knowledge distillation involves the student (DistilBERT) learning from the teacher's outputs. If the tokenization is different, the input tokens won't align, and the student can't learn effectively. For this reason, always **use the same tokenizer as the teacher model (BERT tokenizer)** and this guarantees smooth transfer of learned knowledge and ensures same vocabulary, same token splitting, same input IDs and attention masks.
